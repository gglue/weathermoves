1. Clone the repository or download it as zip
2. Open the root directory of project
3. Create a new file named '.env'. This is where you store the API key.
4. In the .env file write and save the API key like this:`REACT_APP_API_KEY=randomlettershere`
5. Open a terminal at project root folder, execute `npm start`
6. On your mobile device, open a web browser and enter server's local ip address & port (ex. `10.0.0.127:3000`)
